# Theory

A semiprime $N$ is the product of two primes.
For any integer $a < N$, the remainder when $a^b$ is divided by $N$, has period $r$ such that:
```
a^(b+r) - a^b â‰¡ 0 (mod N)
```
Setting $b = 0$ allows us to write $N$ as a product of two smaller factors:
```
a^r â‰¡ 1 (mod N)
a^r - 1 â‰¡ 0 (mod N)
(a^(r/2))^2 - 1 â‰¡ 0 (mod N)
(a^(r/2) - 1)(a^(r/2) + 1) â‰¡ 0 (mod N)
```
Therefore, we can find the factors of $N$ from by finding $r$ (given that $r$ is even).

This makes factoring $N$ a period-finding problem, which Shor's algorithm solves in polynomial time.
Classical factorisation algorithms are exponentially complex for increasing $N$.

RSA encryption involves the generation of a public semiprime key, hence Shor's algorithm can be utilised to find the private decryption key to decrypt the corresponding messages.
Classical computers would take billions of years to break RSA-2048, but a quantum computer would take weeks!

## Classical Pre-Processing

There is no point running Shor's algorithm if $N$ is trivially even or a perfect power.
Therefore, we quickly checks that these conditions are both false.

When we randomly pick a smaller integer $a$, there is a small chance that we directly get one of the factors.
If this is the case, then we simply pick another random integer until $gcd(a, N) = 1$, meaning $a$ and $N$ are coprime.

If these conditions are satisfied, then we continue to the quantum part.

## Quantum Operations

Two registers are used.
The first will be of size $n$, which is the smallest integer such that $2^n \geq N$.
For this project, the second register will have an equal number of qubits as the first.
The initial state is set to $|0âŸ©|0âŸ©$.

### Hadamard Gates

Hadamard operators are used to create a superposition of all possible states, with equal amplitudes, for the first register only.
A Hadamard matrix for one qubit is given as:
```
H = (1/âˆš2) * [ [1,  1],
               [1, -1] ]
```
The Hadamard matrices are then applied to all qubits in the first register by iterating ```numpy.kron()``` - which calculates the Kronecker product of two matrices.
The full Hadamard matrix is then multiplied with the identity matrix (for the second register), also by using the Kronecker product.

### Modular Oracle

A unitary matrix $U$ which maps $|xâŸ©|yâŸ© \rightarrow |xâŸ©|(y + a^x) mod NâŸ©$ is generated.
This leaves the first register unchanged, but entangles it with the second - while encoding periodicity.

### Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (IQFT)

An IQFT matrix is constructed to make the amplitudes of the first register states periodic.
Peaks in probability form at every $2^n * k / r$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.

In this project, probabilities are plotted against the state index to find the period $r$.
In a real implementation of Shor's algorithm, a measurement of the first register would have to be taken for a chance of finding $r$.
(I say "chance", because both $k$ and $r$ might be even - leading to degeneracy in what $r$ could be.)

## Classical Post Processing

$r$ must be even to calculate the factors $(a^{r/2} \pm 1)$.
If $r$ is not even, the algorithm needs to be restarted with a different random integer $a$.
We then verify that the factors returned aren't trivially $N$ and $1$.

## Default Example

#### Modular Periodicity

The simplest example is factoring $N = 15$ into $3$ and $5$, as it is the smallest non-trivial semiprime.
Lets say $a = 7$, then we can see that $a^x mod N$ is periodic:
```
7 ** 0 mod 15 = 1
7 ** 1 mod 15 = 7
7 ** 2 mod 15 = 4
7 ** 3 mod 15 = 13
7 ** 4 mod 15 = 1
7 ** 5 mod 15 = 7
        â‹®
```
(Therefore, $r = 4$ for $a = 7$ and $N = 15$; but lets get the period from simulating Shor's algorithm!)

#### Qubit Number

The smallest power of $2$ greater than $N$ is $16 = 2^4$, hence the number of qubits in the first register required is $n = 4$.
Therefore, the total number of qubits in the total register is $8$.

#### Hadamard Matrix

Applying a Hadamard operator on a qubit $|0âŸ©$ gives:
```
H|0âŸ© = (1/âˆš2) * (|0âŸ© + |1âŸ©)
```
and applying $H$ on all qubits in the first register:
```
(H_1 âŠ— H_2 âŠ— H_3 âŠ— H_4)|0âŸ© = (1 / 4) * (|0âŸ© + |1âŸ© + ... + |15âŸ©)
```
(However, in the python file quanutm_part.py, ```H_1 âŠ— H_2 âŠ— ... âŠ— H_n``` is multiplied with the itentity $I_{16 \times 16}$ to leave the second register unchanged.
This is a $256 \times 256$ matrix, which is already quite big considering this is the trivial example.)

#### Unitary Matrix

Writing the oracle unitary operator as:
```
U = âˆ‘âˆ‘(|xâŸ©|(y + a ** x) mod NâŸ©âŸ¨y|âŸ¨x|)
```
where both $âˆ‘$ run from $0$ to $2^n - 1 = 15$; we can see that this maps:
```
|0âŸ©|yâŸ© â†’ |0âŸ©|y + 1âŸ©
|1âŸ©|yâŸ© â†’ |1âŸ©|y + 7âŸ©
       â‹®
|15âŸ©|yâŸ© â†’ |15âŸ©|y + 13âŸ©
```
The element $j, k$ is $1$, where $j$ and $k$ are the output and input states respectively.
```
j = x * 16 + (y + 7 ** x mod 15)
k = x * 16 + y
```
All other elements are $0$.

#### IQFT Matrix

For the IQFT operator, the element $j, k$ is:
```
(1 / 4) * exp(2Ï€i * j * k / 16)
```
Applying this matrix increases the probabilities of measuring the states $|0âŸ©, |4âŸ©, |8âŸ©, |12âŸ©$, while decreasing those for all other states.
These state numbers are multiples of $4$ - which is the period $r$.

#### Result

Post-processing checks will be passed, as $r$ is even; so there is no need to restart the algorithm with a different $a$.
Therefore, the factors are:
```
(a ** (r / 2)) + 1 mod N = (7 ** (4 / 2)) + 1 mod 15 = 5
(a ** (r / 2)) - 1 mod N = (7 ** (4 / 2)) - 1 mod 15 = 3
```
such that $15 = 5 * 3$.
